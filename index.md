## [About me](<rgb(12,43,54)>)

My name is Matthew Ikai Bernard and I am a 3rd year transfer at UCSD. And by 3rd year transfer, I mean I transferred in Fall 2020 and this is my third year here. I am a Math-CS major aspiring to be a front end developer. Using React have done a couple of small projects such as a [contact book manager](https://github.com/mibernard/Contact-Book) and a [digital watch](https://github.com/mibernard/Digital-Watch). I have also been an intern for a small startup for almost a year with the title of software engineer. However, my responsibilities have largely revolved around UX/UI design with Figma and wordpress website development(which really shows how vague the title software engineer can be). I do believe I gained something out of my internship but not exactly what I wanted in terms of advancing my technical skills. It follows that I really would like to make the most of my time/courses here to further my career as much as possible! Job anxiety is real.

## The classes I want to take during my final year

- [x] CSE 110
- [ ] CSE 112
- [ ] CSE 134B

## Hobbies

- gaming (multiplayer competitive games)
- working out
- going out to eat
- microwaving frozen food
- watching shows(netflix originals and anime)
- stock/options investing
- scrolling endlessly on tiktok wannabes
- following react courses online
