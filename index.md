## [About me](<rgb(12,43,54)>)

My name is Matthew Ikai Bernard and I am a 3rd year transfer at UCSD. And by 3rd year transfer, I mean I transferred in Fall 2020 and this is my third year here. I am a Math-CS major not because I was rejected from normal CS and this was my backup but mainly because I originally thought CS at UCSD was just moved into the math department and this was the "normal CS". Ya kinda embarrasing but hey at least I dont have to take CSE 140 and 141. I am also wasian - half chinese half caucasian, although apparently I am super white passing and no one can actually tell I am half.

Some of my hobbies include:

- gaming (multiplayer competitive games)
- working out
- going out to eat
- microwaving frozen food
- watching shows(netflix originals and anime)
- stock/options investing
- scrolling endlessly on tiktok wannabes
- following react courses online

As a programmer I wish to go the path of front end. Using React have done a couple of small projects such as a [contact book manager](https://github.com/mibernard/Contact-Book) and a [digital watch](https://github.com/mibernard/Digital-Watch) and a WIP expense manager but nothing too major. I have also been an intern for a small startup for almost a year with the title of software engineer. However, my responsibilities have largely revolved around UX/UI design with Figma and wordpress website development(which really shows how vague the title software engineer can be). I do believe I gained something out of my internship but not exactly what I wanted in terms of advancing my technical skills. It follows that I really would like to make the most of my time/courses here to further my career as much as possible! Job anxiety is real.
